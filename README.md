## Easy Reading Wordpress Widget Plugin ##

**Easy reading** is a WopdPress pluging that provides a simple iconical widget for people having poor vision. 

This pluging was tested with WordPress 4.8.1-4.8.2.

The pluging doen't contain any text information, so the localisation of the plugin isn't required.

### Possibilities of the version 1.0.0 ###

- The widget contains three buttons to control the front-end visualization style via switching the CSS;
- The first button is a switcher between two high-contrast visualization schemes: black-n-white and white-n-black;
- The second button allows to enlarge the fonts of the site;
- The action of the 1st and the 2nd buttons are combined;
- The third button switch the special visualization off.

This version doesn't contains any administrative tools, so it's possible to set the visualization via changing the special CSS files:

- **easy-reading-black.css** for the high-contrast scheme with a black background and a white foreground;   
- **easy-reading-white.css** for the high-contrast scheme with a white background and a black foreground;
- **easy-reading-big.css** for the setting of the enlagred fonts.
